# Homework Relay

An email relay to watch a specific GMail inbox for emails with PDF files, convert their pages to JPEG and forward to another address.

This is a learning project which also will be used to help my son turn in his homework easily.

He takes an online class that only accepts emails of scanned JPEG pages of homework.  Don't ask. :)

He does his homework in a PDF editor and usually emails from there.  This will let him use the same workflow with his new class.

It's also a chance for me to experiment with scalaz's Task and Kleisli.
